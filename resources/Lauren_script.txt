I've had the opportunity to meet many new people recently through work, travel and online apps, but one person in particular stands out to me. Her name is Chloe and we met online. Not only did Chloe and I both aspire to move to South Korea one day, we also share the same Christian faith and MBTI personality type. In all my life, I've never met anyone I had so much in common with. Sometimes it seems like she can read my mind because she says exactly what I'm thinking. Although we only met a few weeks ago, I feel as if I've known her my entire life. I think we're going to be friends for a long time. We've already talked about traveling to Korea together.
