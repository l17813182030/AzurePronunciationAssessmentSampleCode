# Java Console app for the Java Run-Time Environment (JRE) on Windows or Linux

This sample demonstrates various forms of pronunciation assessment using the Speech SDK for Java on Windows or Linux.

> **Note:**
> The Speech SDK for the JRE currently supports only the Windows x64 platform, and [specific Linux distributions and target architectures](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/speech-sdk?tabs=linux).

## Prerequisites

* A subscription key for the Speech service. See [Try the speech service for free](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/get-started).
* A PC (Windows x64 or a supported Linux distribution) capable to run Eclipse,[<sup>[1]</sup>](#footnote1) some sample scenarios require a working microphone.
* Java 8 or 11 JRE/JDK.
* Version 4.8 of [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org), 64-bit.[<sup>[1]</sup>](#footnote1)
* On Ubuntu or Debian, run the following commands for the installation of required packages:

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get update
  sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libasound2
  ```

  * On **Ubuntu 22.04 LTS** it is also required to download and install the latest **libssl1.1** package e.g. from http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/o/openssl/.

* On RHEL or CentOS, run the following commands for the installation of required packages:

  ```sh
  sudo yum update
  sudo yum install alsa-lib java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel openssl
  ```

  * See also [how to configure RHEL/CentOS 7 for Speech SDK](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/speech-service/how-to-configure-rhel-centos-7).
